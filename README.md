### üöÄ Getting Started: Setting Up the Website Locally

Since this website was developed on a local server, follow these steps to set it up in own local environment.

> **Prerequisites:**
> A local server environment is needed to be installed on computer. **[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)** is a great free option that includes Apache (web server) and MySQL (database).

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **üñ•Ô∏è Start Local Server**
    -   Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
    -   Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

2.  **üìÇ Download and Place the Website Files**
    -   Download the **`myblog.zip`** (108 MB) file from the link provided in the `File Structure` section above.
    -   Unzip the downloaded file. This will create a folder named `myblog`.
    -   Move the entire `myblog` folder into the `htdocs` directory inside the XAMPP installation folder (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/`).

3.  **üóÉÔ∏è Create and Import the Database**
    -   Open web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    -   Click on **New** to create a new database. Name it **`myblogdb`** and click "Create".
    -   Select the `myblogdb` database that just created from the left-hand sidebar.
    -   Click on the **Import** tab at the top.
    -   Click "Choose File" and select the **`myblogdb.sql`** file from this repository.
    -   Scroll down and click **Go** to start the import. Wait for it to complete.

4.  **üîó Connect WordPress to the Database**
    -   Navigate to the website files folder: `C:/xampp/htdocs/myblog`.
    -   Find the file named **`wp-config.php`** and open it in a text editor.
    -   Update the following lines to match the local database settings (for a default XAMPP setup, the user is `root` with no password):
        ```php
        /** The name of the database for WordPress */
        define( 'DB_NAME', 'myblogdb' );

        /** Database username */
        define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );

        /** Database password */
        define( 'DB_PASSWORD', '' );
        ```
    -   Save and close the `wp-config.php` file.

5.  **üéâ View the Website!**
    -   Open web browser and navigate to **`http://localhost/myblog`**.
    -   The "Flavors of Malaysia" website should now be running locally!
